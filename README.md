# @jarcelao's Advent of Code 2024

This is a personal archive of my solutions for [AoC 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

Made only with standard Python 3.12

## Notes

Each solution expects an `input.txt` file located in their respective day's folder. You may copy your inputs from the AoC website and place them in this file.
